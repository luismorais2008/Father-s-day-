# Father's day - An introduction

  This project is dedicated to my dear father. It has mostly four components that work separately. 
  However, the file [main.py](https://github.com/luismorais2008/Father-s-day-/blob/main/main.py) makes them work together in a beautiful, personal and outstanding way.
  
## [speak.py](https://github.com/luismorais2008/Father-s-day-/blob/main/speak.py)
 
  Uses a self-explanatory library called Google Text-to-speech to say affectionate things to my father, using a cute voice (which is not mine). Evidently, you can customize what it says. Don't forget to install the Google library.  
  
## [build-video.py](https://github.com/luismorais2008/Father-s-day-/blob/main/build-video.py)

  Takes a picture of me and my father at that moment, sit down on the couch, and attaches it to a video I have previously recorded.
  
## [build-heart.py](https://github.com/luismorais2008/Father-s-day-/blob/main/build-heart.py)

  This code was recycled from Instagram and makes a heart by using the 'turtle' library from python. 
  
## [play-video.py](https://github.com/luismorais2008/Father-s-day-/blob/main/play-video.py)

  This file plays the video which has been built.
